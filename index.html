            We beleive in the power of music. <br>
            Music can shape our communities through both inciting mutual inspiration <br>
            and provoking sprited intellectual critique. <br>
            However, we have noticed that while there exist platforms for facilitating <br>
            this essential culterial discourse around other forms of media such as 
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">movies</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">books</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game" target="_blank">videogames</a>. <br>
            There does not yet exist a platform which fully lends itself to the <b>unique nature of musical culteral discourse.</b><br>
